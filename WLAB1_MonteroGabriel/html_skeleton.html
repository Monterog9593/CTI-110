 <h2>History</h2>
 <p>Before becoming a tourist attraction, the area used to be a fishing spot of the native american tribe know as the Waccamaw.
     In the 18th century, European settles would eventually move in and built houses and a plantationsystem that would extend to the ocean. 
     Around 1900, a contest would be held to name the area, and was named after a local shrub <em>(Myrica cerifera)</em>. 
     In 1937, the Myrtle Beach Municiple Airport was built, allowing for more people to access the area. 
     Since then the are a would become a popular tourist attraction for the general public, and became a revenue source to South Carolina.</p>
