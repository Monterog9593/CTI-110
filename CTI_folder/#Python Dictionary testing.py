#Python Dictionary testing
#this file is to learn how to use dictionary in python


#borrowed code from w3schools

car_value= {
    "Camero": 18.21,
    "Priues": 52.36,
    "Model S": 110,
    "Silverado": 26
}

#The keys represent an automobile, and the value represents the MPG for that vehicle.
A#fter creating the dictionary, create a variable that holds all the keys in the dictionary using the code below. Remember that my_dict will need to be replaced with the variable name that you assign to your dictionary.
#keys = my_dict.keys()
#Print the variable that holds the keys.
#Next, prompt the user to enter one of the vehicles from the dictionary. Keep in mind the key must look exactly the same as it does in the dictionary. Python is case-sensitive.
#Display the mpg for the vehicle that the user entered.
#Prompt the user to enter the number of miles that they will drive the vehicle
#Calculate the gallons of gas needed to drive the specified vehicle the given number of miles.
#Display the gallons of gas needed, rounded to two decimal places. Use an f-string.
